1. Python: Average Function
</h2>

<h4>
Implement a function that:<br>
    1.	Is named avg<br>
    2.	Takes a variable number of integer arguments; it is guaranteed that at least one argument will be passed<br>
    3.	Returns the average value of the passed arguments as a float
    <br>
    <br>
The implementation will be tested by a provided code stub on several input files. Each input file contains one line with space-separated arguments for the function. The function will be called with those arguments, and the returned result will be printed to the output with exactly 2 decimal places.
<br>
<br>
Example

3 arguments are read and passed to the function: 1, 2, and 3. The average is calculated to be (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.00. This is then returned as a float to be printed.

Constraints

•	1 ≤ number of arguments for the function ≤ 100

•	-100 ≤ value of passed arguments ≤ 100

Input Format Format for Custom Testing
In the first and only line, there are space-separated integers that denote the values to be passed to the function.

<h2>
2. Python: Shape Classes with Area Method
</h2>

<h4>
Implement two classes:<br>
    Rectangle:

•	The constructor for Rectangle must take two arguments that denote the lengths of the rectangle's sides.

•	The class must have an area method that returns the area of the rectangle.
<br>
    Circle:

•	The constructor for Circle must take one argument that denotes the radius of the circle.

•	The Circle class must have an area method that returns the area of the circle. To implement the area method, use a precise Pi value, preferably the constant math.pi.

<br>
    Your implementation of all the classes will be tested by a provided code stub on several input files. Each input file contains several queries, and each query constructs an object of one of the classes and prints the area of this object to the standard output with exactly 2 decimal points.
    <br>
    <br>
Constraints

•	1 ≤ the number of queries in one test file ≤ 105

•	1 ≤  the value of all parameters passed to construct the objects ≤ 103

<br>
Input Format Format for Custom Testing

In the first line, there is a single integer, q, the number of queries.
Then, q lines follow. In the ith of them, there are space-separated parameters. The first of them denotes the shape to be constructed, and the remaining parameters denote the parameters for the constructor.
